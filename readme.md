# 🚁 Project Title: Autonomous Telemetry & Control Streams via Pymavlink

### Developer Name: Priyanshu

### Status: Phase 1 – Week 1 Milestone Achieved Successfully

---

# 1. Executive Summary

This project focuses on developing an autonomous UAV control framework using the MAVLink communication protocol and ArduPilot's Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulation environment.

The primary objective of Phase 1 was to establish reliable telemetry and command communication between an independent Python application and a simulated quadcopter flight controller. The implemented solution successfully demonstrated automated mode switching, vehicle arming, autonomous takeoff, hovering, and landing without manual pilot intervention.

The successful completion of this milestone validates the software architecture required for future navigation and mission-planning capabilities.

# 2. Technical Objective

The objectives of Phase 1 were:

* Establish a functional ArduPilot SITL environment.
* Create a MAVLink communication bridge using `pymavlink`.
* Develop an independent Python-based flight controller.
* Programmatically bypass development-stage pre-arm checks.
* Switch the vehicle into GUIDED mode.
* Arm the vehicle remotely.
* Execute an autonomous takeoff sequence.
* Maintain controlled hover.
* Perform a safe autonomous landing sequence.

# 3. System Architecture

The system separates flight simulation from autonomous control logic through network-based communication.

# 4. Network Layout

The communication framework utilizes local TCP sockets.

### Simulation Core

* ArduPilot SITL running ArduCopter firmware.
* Simulates vehicle dynamics and onboard flight controller behavior.

### Telemetry Routing

MAVProxy captures the primary telemetry stream:

```text
tcp:127.0.0.1:5760
```

and exposes a secondary developer endpoint:

```text
tcp:127.0.0.1:5762
```

used by external applications.

# 9. Engineering Challenges & Debugging

## Problem Identified

Running SITL under one Linux user namespace and executing Python scripts under another administrative namespace caused the following error:

```text
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111]
```

The Python application could not access the MAVProxy TCP endpoint.

## Root Cause

Loopback interfaces became isolated due to inconsistent execution environments.

```text
root@DESKTOP
        ≠
priyanshu@DESKTOP
```

---

## Solution Implemented

A unified Python virtual environment was used.

```text
venv-ardupilot
```

All SITL and Python processes were executed within the same user context.

Result:

```text
Stable MAVLink communication established.
```
